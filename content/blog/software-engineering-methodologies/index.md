A software engineering methodology refers to the process of working on a project and aims to provide the best approach to the development of the product. By having a clear methodology, it allows the team to have more structure while working, and provide a more accurate timeline for the delivery of a product.

## Agile
Agile philosophy focusses on a team based approach providing rapid delivery of the product, with a main focus on customer satisfaction. The tasks are split into sprints, which last for 1-4 weeks, and require high intensity effort from the whole team. Communication is key during the process and the developers regularly ask for feedback so that the product best meets the consumer's requirements. 

#### Pros
- Encourages customer/ stakeholder involvlement so product will have a higher customer satisfaction
- Adaptable as if there is any feedback given, the development team can adapt the planned sprints and the priority of deliverables
- Regular testing throughout so easier to fix any bugs

#### Cons
- Only works well if the team are solely focussed on that project
- Deadline can be postponed if deliverables are not met in time, causing higher cost


## Waterfall
There are 7 distinct stages that are arranged in a sequence; each stage needs to be completed before progressing onto next stage. 
The 7 stages are conception, initialistaion and analysis, design, construction and coding, testing, and implementation. 
As the name suggests, the team does not return to a previous stage during the process (waterfalls only flow in one direction).


#### Pros
- There is a clear understanding of the project timeline and deliverables before the project starts
- Each phase is documented clearly
- Developers, customers and stakeholders agree on what will be delivered early on in the process; this makes planning and designing straightforward. 
- Project does not require all of the development team's attention at all times

#### Cons
- Testing is done at the last stage, so it is hard to fix the code if there is a bug
- Difficult to make changes to the project if the team are struggling
- Less customer/ stakeholder involvement


## Lean Development
Lean Development is focussed on minimising wastage and increasing the productivity of a team.

In order to create a lean system, you need to first identify the value in the product you want to deliver. You now map the workflow, seeing where value is being generated and the proportion of value each process provides. This leads to the creation of a continuous workflow. Then, you create a pull system which checks that work is only being pulled if there is a demand; this reduces the amount of resources that are wasted and saves time. Continuous improvement is at the core of lean development; problems can occur at any stage of the process so it is important to be constantly improving the product throughout the process.

#### Pros
- Cost of development is reduced
- Only develop products that are required hence saving time
- Provide a better quality product for customer since non-valuable tasks are removed from production process, allowing more time to be spend refining the product


#### Cons
- Can lead to delays as work is not delivered preemptively
- Lack of strategy specified so can lose sight of overall product


## My Opinion
My ideal methodology would combine the structural aspect of waterfall with the flexibility of agile. Testing should be done regularly throughout the project but the goals and deadlines should be specified before the project starts. Also, stakeholder involvement should be present throughout production in order to best cater the product to the consumer.
