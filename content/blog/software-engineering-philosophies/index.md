## Agile
Agile philosophy focusses on a team based approach providing rapid delivery of the product, with a main focus on customer satisfaction. The tasks are split into sprints, which last for 1-4 weeks, and require high intensity effort from the whole team.

#### Pros
- Encourages customer/ stakeholder involvlement so product will have a higher customer satisfaction
- Adaptable as if there is any feedback given, the development team can adapt the planned sprints and the priority of deliverables
- Regular testing throughout so easier to fix any bugs

#### Cons
- Only works well if the team are solely focussed on that project
- Deadline can be postponed if deliverables are not met in time, causing higher cost


## Waterfall
There are 7 distinct phases; each phase needs to be completed before progressing onto next phase. 
The 7 stages are conception, initialistaion and analysis, design, construction and coding, testing, and implementation.


#### Pros
- There is a clear understanding of the project timeline and deliverables before the project starts
- Each phase is documented clearly
- Developers, customers and stakeholders agree on what will be delivered early on in the process; this makes planning and designing straightforward. 
- Project does not require all of the development team's attention at all times

#### Cons
- Testing is done at the last stage, so it is hard to fix the code if there is a bug
- Difficuly to make changes to the project if the team struggle
 - Less customer/ stakeholder involvement


## Lean Development
Lean Development is focussed on minimising wastage and increasing the productivity of a team.

#### Pros
- Cost of development is reduced
- 


#### Cons
-
